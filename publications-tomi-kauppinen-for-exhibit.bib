@article{geoviz-data-tables-2018,
	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed progress of public institutions in making their datasets available online,  free of charge, for re-use. There have been however limited studies which assess the actual effectiveness  of different communication media in making key facts visible to citizens. This article analysed and  systematically compared two representations which are relevant in the context of open government  data: geovisualizations and data tables. An empirical user study (N=16) revealed that both types of  representations have their strengths: geovisualizations make spatial knowledge and the attractiveness  of open government data more visible, while data tables are more adequate for the communication of numerical data. The ideas presented are relevant to open data publishers interested in strategies to  effectively put the hidden knowledge in current open government datasets into the hands of citizens.

@article{associative-nature-2016,
	abstract = {<p>Participation in conferences is an important part of every scientific career. Conferences provide an opportunity for a fast dissemination of latest results, discussion and exchange of ideas, and broadening of scientists' collaboration network. The decision to participate in a conference depends on several factors like the location, cost, popularity of keynote speakers, and the scientist's association with the community. Here we discuss and formulate the problem of discovering how a scientist's previous participation affects her/his future participations in the same conference series. We develop a stochastic model to examine scientists' participation patterns in conferences and compare our model with data from six conferences across various scientific fields and communities. Our model shows that the probability for a scientist to participate in a given conference series strongly depends on the balance between the number of participations and non-participations during his/her early connections with the community. An active participation in a conference series strengthens the scientist's association with that particular conference community and thus increases the probability of future participations.</p>},

But while challenges such as heterogeneity of data content and quality, asynchronicity, and volume call for robust data integration and interpretation capabilities, situation awareness in crowdsensing for crisis management remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper we extend the mobile4D smartphone-based disaster reporting and alerting system with a situation awareness data interpretation and integration layer and demonstrate its application to the problem of tracking cholera outbreaks. The communication workflow in mobile4D-SA supports interaction between crowdsensed information, system predictions, and multifaceted communication between authorities and affected people on the ground.},

@article{info:doi/10.2196/medinform.3531,
	abstract = {Background: Healthcare organizations around the world are challenged by pressures to reduce cost, improve coordination and outcome, and provide more with less. This requires effective planning and evidence-based practice by generating important information from available data. Thus, flexible and user-friendly ways to represent, query, and visualize health data becomes increasingly important. International organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) regularly publish vital data on priority health topics that can be utilized for public health policy and health service development. However, the data in most portals is displayed in either Excel or PDF formats, which makes information discovery and reuse difficult. Linked Open Data (LOD)---a new Semantic Web set of best practice of standards to publish and link heterogeneous data---can be applied to the representation and management of public level health data to alleviate such challenges. However, the technologies behind building LOD systems and their effectiveness for health data are yet to be assessed. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether Linked Data technologies are potential options for health information representation, visualization, and retrieval systems development and to identify the available tools and methodologies to build Linked Data-based health information systems. Methods: We used the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for data representation, Fuseki triple store for data storage, and Sgvizler for information visualization. Additionally, we integrated SPARQL query interface for interacting with the data. We primarily use the WHO health observatory dataset to test the system. All the data were represented using RDF and interlinked with other related datasets on the Web of Data using Silk---a link discovery framework for Web of Data. A preliminary usability assessment was conducted following the System Usability Scale (SUS) method. Results: We developed an LOD-based health information representation, querying, and visualization system by using Linked Data tools. We imported more than 20,000 HIV-related data elements on mortality, prevalence, incidence, and related variables, which are freely available from the WHO global health observatory database. Additionally, we automatically linked 5312 data elements from DBpedia, Bio2RDF, and LinkedCT using the Silk framework. The system users can retrieve and visualize health information according to their interests. For users who are not familiar with SPARQL queries, we integrated a Linked Data search engine interface to search and browse the data. We used the system to represent and store the data, facilitating flexible queries and different kinds of visualizations. The preliminary user evaluation score by public health data managers and users was 82 on the SUS usability measurement scale. The need to write queries in the interface was the main reported difficulty of LOD-based systems to the end user. Conclusions: The system introduced in this article shows that current LOD technologies are a promising alternative to represent heterogeneous health data in a flexible and reusable manner so that they can serve intelligent queries, and ultimately support decision-making. However, the development of advanced text-based search engines is necessary to increase its usability especially for nontechnical users. Further research with large datasets is recommended in the future to unfold the potential of Linked Data and Semantic Web for future health information systems development. },

Recently, gestural interaction has emerged as a promis- ing option, which has been successfully applied to various domains, including simple map control. In this paper, we investigate whether gestures can be used to enable non-experts to explore and understand complex spatiotemporal phenomena. In this case study we made use of large amounts of Linked Open Data about the deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest and related ecological, economical and social factors. The results of our study indicate that people of all

@article{kauppinen-et-al-temporal-relevance-2010,
	abstract = {Time is an essential concept in cultural heritage applications. Instances of temporal concepts such as time intervals are used for the annotation of cultural objects and also for querying datasets containing information about these objects. Hence it is important to match query and annotation intervals by examining their similarity or closeness. One of the problems is that in many cases time intervals are imprecise. For example, the boundaries of the ``Pre-Roman age'' and the ``Roman age'' are inherently imprecise and it may be difficult to distinguish them with clear-cut intervals. In this paper we apply the fuzzy set theory to model imprecise time intervals in order to determine relevance of the relationship between two time intervals. We present a method for matching query and annotation intervals based on their weighted mutual overlapping and closeness. We present 1) methods for calculating these weights to produce a combined measure and 2) results of comparing the combined measure with human evaluators as a case study. The case study takes into consideration archaeological temporal information, which is in most cases inherently fuzzy, and therefore offers a particularly complex and challenging scenario. The results show that our new combined measure that utilizes different weighted measures together in rankings, performs the best in terms of precision and recall. It should be used when ranking annotation intervals according to a given query interval in cultural heritage information retrieval. Our approach intends to be generalizable: overlapping and closeness may be calculated between any two fuzzy temporal intervals. The presented procedure of using user evaluation results as a basis for assigning weights for overlapping and closeness could potentially be used to reveal weights in other domains and purposes as well.},

@article{modeling-sensor-observations-2012,
	abstract = {In this paper, we argue that sensors provide a better understanding of geographic events. They produce observations that reflect the natural events taking place at a particular location. The essential part of deriving information about geographic events from sensor observations is to formalize the relations between them. In this spirit, we develop an ontology to capture the relations between weather events and properties observed by sensors. A case study is investigated to illustrate how blizzard events can be formally represented in relation to a set of atmospheric properties observed by a weather station. We use the historical weather records from the Canadian Climate Archives database to evaluate our approach. Using the ontological structures, we define and implement rules to reason about blizzard events from hourly weather observations. The result includes an interactive timeline illustrating the events. The approach is evaluated in terms of reasoning and querying support agains a local use.},

@article{futureSDI-2012,
	abstract = {The term Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) was defined in the nineties as a set of policies, technologies and institutional arrangements for improving the availability and accessibility of spatial data and information. SDIs are typically driven by governmental organizations, and thus follow top-down structures based on regulations and agreements. The drawback is that it renders SDIs less easily capable of evolving with new technological trends. While organizations are still struggling to implement SDIs, the World Wide Web is increasingly developing into a Geospatial Web, i.e. one that extensively supports the spatial and temporal aspects of information. This article is our contribution to the discussion on the future technological directions in the field of SDIs. We give a conceptual view of the dynamics of both SDIs and the Geospatial Web. We present a picture of the SDI of the future, one which benefits from these developments, based on an analysis of geoinformatics research topics and current ICT trends. We provide recommendations on how to improve the adaptability and usability of SDIs as to facilitate the assimilation of new ICT developments and to leverage self-reinforcing growth.},

	abstract = {Georeferencing and semantic annotations improve the find- ability of geoinformation because they exploit relationships to existing data and hence facilitate queries. Unlike georeferencing, which grounds location information in reference points on the earth's surface, seman- tic annotations often lack relations to entities of shared experience. We suggest an approach to semantically reference geoinformation based on underlying observations, relating data to observable entities and actions. After discussing an ontology for an observer's domain of experience, we demonstrate our approach through two use cases. First, we show how to distinguish geosensors based on observed properties and abstracting from technical implementations. Second, we show how to complement annotations of volunteered geographic information with observed affordances.},

@inproceedings{onkigeo-2007,
	abstract = {Geographic place names are widely used but
are semantically often highly ambiguous. For example, there are 491
places in Finland sharing the same name ``Isosaari'' (great island)
that are instances of several geographical classes, such as Island,
Forest, Peninsula, Inhabited area, etc. Referencing
unambiguously to a particular ``Isosaari'',
either when annotating content or during information retrieval, can
be quite problematic and requires usage of advanced search methods
and maps for semantic disambiguation. This paper presents an
ontology server, ONKI-Paikka, for solving the place finding and
place name disambiguation problem. In ONKI-Paikka, places can be found by a faceted search
engine, combined with semantic autocompletion and a map service
for constraining search and for visualizing results. The service can
be connected to legacy applications cost-effectively by using
Ajax-technology in the same spirit as Google Maps that is used in

	abstract = {Many tasks on the semantic web require the user to choose concepts 
from a limited vocabulary e.g. for describing an indexed resource or 
for use in semantic search. Semantic autocompletion interfaces offer 
an efficient way for concept selection. However, these interfaces 
usually do not expose the semantic context of the matched concepts, 
thereby making it hard to know if a matched concept is the right one, 
as well as hiding possibly more appropriate choices. Ontology 
browsers, on the other hand, show context but do not allow quick 
discovery or embedding into other applications. To lessen these 
problems, we present an interface combining semantic autocompletion 
with in-place ontological context navigation. Because required context 
differs between ontologies, the implementation was designed to make it 
easy to add different contexts and visualizations.  To test the 
applicability of our idea and implementation the, system was tested on 
three ontologies with different requirements and structure. },

	abstract = {Ontologies aim to capture knowledge about things and their relationships. Publishing ontologies on the Semantic Web enables people and 
  organizations to use shared ontologies in annotating e.g. photographs, videos, music, and
  other types of cultural objects. Search engines also use relationships provided
  by ontologies in semantic search, e.g. for query expansion or for view-based
  search. However, building ontologies is a time-consuming process, and it should
  be helped by automatic finding of interesting, possible relationships. Finding the
  correct concept for annotation purposes is helped by subsumption and partonomy
  hierarchies and associative relationships. In this paper we show how an analysis
  of co-occurrences of concepts in annotations can be used to provide interesting
  relationships for enriching ontological structures. We use association rule mining techniques and test the idea using a set of annotations of cultural objects in
  CULTURESAMPO portal and the Finnish General Upper Ontology YSO. The results are visualized in the ONKI SKOS browser to give an additional layer on
  top of the original relationships of the YSO ontology. An analysis shows that
  best ranked relationships should also be included in the ontology as subclassof or
  associative relationships.

In this chapter we present and discuss a set of methods for searching and browsing spatio-

These methods have been implemented in the semantic cultural heritage portal CULTURESAMPO that offers map-based interfaces for a user to explore hundreds of thousands of content objects and points of interest in Finland. Our goal is to develop and demonstrate novel ways to help the user 1) to decide where to go for a trip, and 2) to learn more about the neighborhoods and points of interest during the visit. },

The result then is a series of ontologies whose concepts are related with each other not only within one ontology valid at a moment but through the time, too. This chapter presents a model for representing ontology time series. The focus is on modeling partial overlap between concepts evolving over long periods of time, and the domain of application is historical geospatial reasoning. A framework is presented for representing and reasoning about conceptual overlap of concepts that evolve over an ontology time series. The idea is to provide the ontology developer with an intuitive change ontology for expressing local ontological changes in a declarative way. An algorithm is presented for reasoning about overlapping concepts globally over long periods of time. This algorithm can be applied, e.g., in concept-based information retrieval for ranking search results according to their relevance.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an ontology-based query expansion widget which utilizes the ontologies published in the ONKI Ontology
Service. The widget can be integrated into a web page, e.g. a search
system of a museum catalogue, enhancing the page by providing a query
expansion functionality. We have tested the system with general,
domain-specific and spatio-temporal ontologies.},
